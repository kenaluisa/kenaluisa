## ðŸš€ About me

I am a front-end developer taking my first steps in my career. I am exploring this new world with an open mind. I speak Spanish, Portuguese, and a little English.

My most significant contribution was to the LeMonth project, where I utilized Figma tools, responsive design, and some React through the Aptugo tool.

I am open to opportunities where I can learn and collaborate using my skills, with a vision for career growth, while improving my soft skills and achieving a fulfilling job.
